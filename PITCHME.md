# So about CI/CD...

Note:
I've been part of development teams where code would take weeks or months before it was pushed to testing, and often months before it would be deployed to production. And that was just one team, working on one feature, while other teams worked on other features doing the same thing. It was also not uncommon to be working on a project for a year - only to have it dumped because the business and/or customer had already moved past the need. Who here would prefer slow code delivery cycles? Every technology delivery team wants to increase their code delivery velocity and the quality of the code they push to market.

## TickTock

Note:
Time is a dev's most important and valuable asset. If we don't manage our time properly, then we're not able to accomplish our goals, finish our projects per their deadlines, right? And we'll also run the risk of, you know, failing our team in regards to delivering tasks and software, right? Often times devs get wrapped up in our own heads sometimes, you know, when we're doing a pretty intensive work on trying to fix bugs manually, and we encounter these moments that we'll call time sucks, right? Where we're just spinning our wheels, right. We're looking for bugs, for problems within the code base. And a lot of times we can leverage some other tooling, right, to help us with these these time sucks that we get ourselves into.

# "DevOps"

![What is devops](assets/img/devops_is_coming.jpeg)

Note:
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and information-technology operations (Ops) which aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

## Continuous {Integration|Delivery}
@snapend

Note:
CI/CD are Principles & Practices that enable teams to release quality code
Fail Fast is the most important here. The ability to know when stuff is broken is invaluable. It leads to faster fixes and delivery of quality code. Quickly fix issues, resubmit fixes. Deliver stable code consistently.

- Merge code changes often
- Run automated tests to validate builds
- Only integrate tested code into code base
- Changes frequently merged into release branches
@ulend
@snapend

Note: 
Continuous integration is the practice where developers are merging code often to a shared code base. Meaning, if you have a repo on GitHub and you have, let’s say ten developers, all ten developers will branch from that shared code base and they’ll have an individual siloed based on their development environments. And, as they’re writing code they are continuously pushing code up into this shared code base. The reason for that is sometimes when we write code it can take us a week, two weeks, whatever the time frame is and what that means is if you are developing in isolation the rest of your team doesn’t really know what’s happening until push those changes upstream, right, to that upstream repo. So that, they can pull them down and see what’s going on. By doing so the team is more informed about what each other’s code base looks like and the potential future conflicts that could arise. So as developers are merging codebase changes often, we want to run automated tests, right, automated tests to validate these builds. So, as you’re pushing your code base up stream we’re definitely inclined to start running these automated tests to insure the code that you’re pushing is actually of quality. Again, only tested code is integrated into the code base and then the merge of these changes are frequently released to our production branch or our release branch. Continuous integration gets us a speed in a sense that, you know, once you write some code, you push it up stream and automation takes over, and it them validates those builds to insure that you’re only pushing quality code into the production branches.

- Faster release cycles
- Low-risk releases
- Higher quality
- Lower costs
@ulend
@snapend


Note:
Now, continuous delivery is basically automation that helps us with releasing our software faster. Actually, in most occasions smarter, and it's also ensuring that we are lowering risks to our release processes. The code and the software being released should be, it should be at a higher quality. And then by using these continuous delivery mechanisms you're actually lowering your costs. You're lowering the cost for time for your developers. You should be lowering your costs for actual billable items such as, time spent delivering software to multiple infrastructures. Could be that you're delivering software to staging. Could be delivering software to maybe a QA type of environment. And then you're also lowering costs to delivering software to your production level infrastructures.

## So now can I CI/CD?
@snapend

Note:
As we mentioned when defining DevOps as a term, much has changed in the way that developers build and ship code. In implementing CI/CD, you're implementing practices and principles which aren't really about tooling. It's important that you and your teams sit down and decide how you will implememnt CI/CD practices and principles. CI/CD aims to break down the walls between Dev and Ops and get everyone on the same page working together. You don't have to implement CI/CD all at once. Instead, thing about it as iterative in and of itself. The systems and tech currently in place in your organization, combined with the culture (which in itself might need to be reformed) dramatically incluence the customization needed to implement.

## CI or CD?
@snapend

Note:
Continuous integration automates the building and testing of your software. Continuous deployment is an extension of this automation and allows for your software to be deployed after every code commit that passes your test suite. The most successful development teams deploy their software often.

The software development process consists of three main centers of work:

---
@snap[midpoint]
### Code creation
@snapend

Note: 
Creation of the code: This is where the software development team is the most creative. They are turning user stories into elegant code. The most important tool here would be the VCS like GitHub, BitBucket, etc.

---
@snap[midpoint]
### Code orchestration
@snapend

Note: 
Orchestration of new code as software: This is where the heart of continuous integration lives. Once the developer commits code, the continuous integration build server automates the build, test, and deploy process. It does the heavy lifting of turning the code into working software. Users configure how the code is processed via a config file, usually YAML, and this file often allows for almost infinite configurations, allowing teams to build and test their way.

---
@snap[midpoint]
### Code logistics
@snapend

Note: 
Logistics: This is the final step of shipping the new software to production. The logistics part of the software development process includes getting the tested and approved code into production. This includes the setup, configuration, and management of the production servers. To gain the full benefit of continuous integration, continuous deployment is necessary.

---
@snap[midpoint]
## So now CI?
@snapend

Note:
It is important to get a continuous integration (CI) pipeline set up as early as possible in the development of your application. Once tests are added to your CI pipeline, you can continue to innovate and build with confidence knowing that you cannot merge code to master that doesn’t pass your tests. Additionally, developing a continuous deployment workflow into your CI pipeline provides the automation of deployment. Automating your software’s build, test, and deployment is important to getting back to work building the features that your users care about the most.
